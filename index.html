            <h2>About This Site</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 6%;">
                I have spent the last two years studying web development and have been trying to figure out a way 
                to incorporate my photography archives with what I've learned. I wanted to create a personal stock
                image porfolio of the work I've done in Photography and have it be accessible for anyone who wanted 
                to use any of my images for the web. My past archives are mostly live performance and portraits
                throughout the 90's and early 2000's! I've recently taken a liking to photographing birds. This site 
                will be dedicated to my images of Bands and Birds and the occasional non music portrait!

            <h2>My Services</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 6%;">Photography has always been a vehicle for self expression as it relates to the 
                subject of my image. The photographs I've taken represent a time stamp into what my interests were 
                at a given time. In my early 20's I wanted to be part of the music scene but without having to play 
                in the band, I wanted to capture the energy of the music I felt was special and exciting at the time.
                in my 30's I branched into the business of photography. Recieved paid gigs and assignments which felt 
                amazing to be a part of. To actually get to do this as a job was such a thrill and feeling of accomplishment. But things 
                change throughout time and sometimes your progress feels like a tiring chase. I still shoot pictures,
                but these day's its back full circle to being a hobby! Which is kinda were I like keeping my creative
                interests.  I've recently become interested in birding, I've never considered myslef a wildlife photographer
                but really enjoy what I've learned about my subject while in this process. I've wanted to learn more about 
                these birds that I've photographed and am really excited that this has led me to expand my knowledge of the
                different types of birds, their feeding habits, what time of year they are more visible and just the similarities 
                and diffrences between the different species. Just stuff that I never gave a second thought about in the past. 
                It's really cool to now know what particular kind of bird I am looking at and be able to identify them in their
                environment. I feel very fortunate to have found photography as a creative outlet in my life. Photograpy has 
                been such a presence in my life that its very hard to not think in terms of creating imagery out of subjects 
                I have an interest in. Its been a while since I've stepped away from assinment photography but I'm still open 
                to doing commissioned shoots! So please feel free to get in touch if you have any inqueries! I can also put together
                webApps like this one built on html, css and some plain vanilla javascript! </p>
